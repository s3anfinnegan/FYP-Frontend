# FYP-Frontend
This is the frontend component of my FYP (React based)

### Breakdown of frontend components
-> Point of Sale (POS): This emulates the POS behaviour and generates the sale, sending the receipt to the MongoDB database and then displaying a dynamic QR Code for the sale based on the ObjectID

-> Receipt List: This is a history of all receipts that have generated (more for convenience than functionality)

### Currently doing...
The next step will be generating the pdf receipt and linking to Xero. I am aiming to have successful hits to Xero by the first week of March.
