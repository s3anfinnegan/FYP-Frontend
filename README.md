# FYP-Frontend
This is the frontend component of my FYP (React based)

### Breakdown of frontend components
ðŸ§¾ Point of Sale (POS): This emulates the POS behaviour and generates the sale, sending the receipt to the MongoDB database and then displaying a dynamic QR Code for the sale based on the ObjectID

ðŸ§¾ Receipt List: This is a history of all receipts that have generated (more for convenience than functionality)

ðŸ§¾ e-Receipt: This tab displays the current e-receipt 

### Currently doing...
Receipts are successfully being generated from the POS and I am now doing some CSS formatting for tge e-receipt presentation. The next step is to upload to Xero via
the e-receipt. I am still aiming to have successful hits to Xero by the first week of March.
