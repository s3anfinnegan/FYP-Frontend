# FYP-Frontend
This is the frontend component of my FYP (React based)

### Breakdown of frontend components
-> Point of Sale (POS): This emulates the POS behaviour and generates the sale, sending the receipt to the MongoDB database

-> Receipt List: This is a history of all receipts that have generated (more for convenience than functionality)

-> QR Code: A unique QR code is generated for each database entry based on the ObjectID. The user scans this QR code to get their receipt
