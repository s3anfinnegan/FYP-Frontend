# FYP-Frontend
This is the frontend component of my FYP (React based)

### Breakdown of frontend components
ðŸ§¾ Point of Sale (POS): This emulates the POS behaviour and generates the sale, sending the receipt to the MongoDB database and then displaying a dynamic QR Code for the sale based on the ObjectID

ðŸ§¾ Receipt List: This is a history of all receipts that have generated (more for convenience than functionality)

ðŸ§¾ e-Receipt: This tab displays the current e-receipt 

### Currently doing...
I am on the final step of the project now. I am aiming to be uploading expenses to Xero this week.

### MERN system architecture
